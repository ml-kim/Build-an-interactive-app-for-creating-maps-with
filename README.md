# Build-an-interactive-app-for-creating-maps-with-Panel

* In this note, I create an interactive app for creating maps using a data set that includes the prices of seoul apartments.
>* These maps show the distribution of APT complexes whose transaction volumes are greater than certain levels and their average prices.

* The libraries used: `panda`, `panel` and `folium`
